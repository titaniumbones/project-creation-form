# Project Name

Choose a clear, descriptive name that conveys the project's purpose at a glance.

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: "Climate Data Analysis for Northeast Region" is better than "Data Project"
- **Include context**: Consider adding the year, client, or region if relevant
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for 3-8 words
- **Avoid jargon**: Use terms that stakeholders outside your team will understand

## Examples

✅ **Good names:**
- "2025 Annual Impact Assessment"
- "Water Quality Dashboard Development"
- "Community Health Data Integration"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Project 1"
- "Data stuff"
- "TBD"
