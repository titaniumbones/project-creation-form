## Example

> This project will develop an automated data pipeline to streamline the monthly reporting process for the Finance team. Currently, reports are generated manually from three separate systems (Salesforce, QuickBooks, and internal databases), taking approximately 20 hours per month and introducing frequent data entry errors.
>
> The new pipeline will:
> - Automatically extract data from all three sources daily
> - Validate and reconcile figures across systems
> - Generate standardized reports in the required format
> - Reduce monthly effort to under 2 hours
> - Eliminate common reconciliation errors
>
> This project does NOT include changes to the source systems themselves or modifications to the report format (which is mandated by external requirements).
