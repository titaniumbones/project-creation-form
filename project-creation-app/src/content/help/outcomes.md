# Outcomes & Milestones

Define the key deliverables and milestones for your project. These create checkpoints to track progress and celebrate achievements.

## What's the Difference?

### Outcomes
Tangible deliverables or results that the project will produce.
- A completed report
- A deployed system
- A trained team

### Milestones
Significant points in the project timeline marking progress.
- Phase completion
- Key decision points
- External deadlines

## Best Practices

### Be Specific
❌ "Complete analysis"
✅ "Deliver final analysis report with recommendations"

### Include Enough Detail
Each outcome should have:
- A clear name
- Brief description (optional but helpful)
- Target due date (when known)

### Reasonable Number
- Aim for 3-10 outcomes for most projects
- Too few: hard to track progress
- Too many: overwhelming to manage

## Example Outcomes

| Name | Description | Due Date |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Requirements Document | Finalized scope and requirements approved by stakeholders | Jan 15 |
| Data Pipeline MVP | Working pipeline for primary data source | Feb 28 |
| User Acceptance Testing | Complete UAT with Finance team | Mar 15 |
| Production Deployment | System live in production environment | Mar 31 |
| Documentation Complete | User guides and technical documentation | Apr 7 |

## Tips

- Order outcomes chronologically when possible
- Include both internal milestones and external deliverables
- Leave due dates blank if truly unknown (but estimate when possible)
- These will become tasks in your Asana board
