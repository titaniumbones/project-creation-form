# Objectives

Objectives define what success looks like for this project. They should be specific, measurable outcomes that the project aims to achieve.

## Writing Good Objectives

### SMART Framework
- **Specific**: Clearly define what will be accomplished
- **Measurable**: Include criteria for measuring progress
- **Achievable**: Be realistic about what can be done
- **Relevant**: Align with broader organizational goals
- **Time-bound**: Tied to the project timeline

### Focus on Outcomes, Not Activities
Write what will be different when the project is complete, not the tasks you'll do.

❌ "Analyze customer data"
✅ "Identify top 3 factors driving customer churn"

## Example Objectives

1. **Reduce manual data entry time by 80%** through automation of the three-source reconciliation process.

2. **Achieve 99.5% data accuracy** in monthly financial reports, up from current ~95%.

3. **Enable same-day reporting** instead of the current 3-day turnaround.

4. **Document all data transformations** to meet audit compliance requirements.

## Tips

- Limit to 3-6 key objectives
- Prioritize if needed (primary vs. secondary objectives)
- Each objective should be independently valuable
- Consider what stakeholders will use to judge success
