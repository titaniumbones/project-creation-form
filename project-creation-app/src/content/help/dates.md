# Project Dates

Set the overall timeline for your project.

## Start Date

When active work on this project begins. Consider:
- When will team members start dedicating time?
- Are there prerequisites that must be complete first?
- Is there a kickoff meeting scheduled?

## End Date

When the project is expected to be complete. Consider:
- When are final deliverables due?
- Is there a hard deadline (external commitment)?
- Include buffer time for review and revisions

## Tips

- Be realistic—projects often take longer than expected
- If uncertain, estimate conservatively
- Dates can be updated as the project progresses
- The date range affects Asana project timeline views
